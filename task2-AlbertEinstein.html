        <h3>10 Thing You Didn't Know About Albert Einstein:</h3>

            <li>
                Einstein didn’t fail math as a child.The future Nobel Laureate dropped out of school at age 15 and left Germany to avoid state-mandated military service, but before then he was consistently at the top of his class and was even considered something of a prodigy for his grasp of complex mathematical and scientific concepts.
            </li>
            <li>
                No one knows what happened to his first daughter. Einstein never spoke about the child to his family, and biographers weren’t even aware of her existence until examining his private papers in the late-1980s.

                It took Einstein nine years to get a job in academia. While the discoveries marked Einstein’s entrance onto the physics world stage, he didn’t win a full professorship until 1909—nearly a decade after he had left school.
            </li>
            <li>
                He offered his wife his Nobel Prize as part of their divorce settlement.  As part of their separation agreement, Einstein promised her an annual stipend plus whatever money he might receive from the Nobel Prize—which he was supremely confident he would eventually win.
            </li>
            <li> 
                A solar eclipse helped make Einstein world famous. According to Einstein biographer Walter Isaacson, in the six years after the 1919 eclipse, more than 600 books and articles were written about the theory of relativity.
            </li>
            <li>
                The FBI spied on him for decades. Agents listened to the physicist’s phone calls, opened his mail and rooted through his trash in the hope of unmasking him as a subversive or a Soviet spy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Einstein urged the building of the atomic bomb—and later became a proponent of nuclear disarmament.
            </li>
            <li>
                Einstein’s brain was stolen after his death.  After winning a reluctant approval from Einstein’s son, Harvey later had the brain cut into pieces and sent to various scientists for research.
            </li>
            <li>
                He was great musician. Martinů discovered that Einstein could play the violin at quite a reasonable standard and that he loved playing Mozart Sonatas with pianist Robert Casadesus.
            </li>
            <li>
                He loved to sail.For Einstein, sailing was an escape. "He used to sail as a way to think. I think he loved the solitude of it, the serenity of it." Lynch explained. "He liked to go out during doldrums, and jot down ideas about the universe."
            </li>
